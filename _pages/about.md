I am currently a PhD student in the Electronic and Computer Engineering department of [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), [AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems](https://inno-access.hk/), and a member of [Vision and System Design Lab (VSDL)](https://vsdl.hkust.edu.hk/index.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Kwang-Ting CHENG](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng). I obtained my BEng degree in Microelectronic Science and Engineering from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in 2022, advised by [Prof. Fengwei An](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/anfw/en/). My research realm focuses on computer vision, model compression, AI chip, computer architecture, and software-hardware co-design. You can find more information through my [CV](../images/CanadaCast_CV_example.pdf). Welcome to contact with me if you have any interests.
